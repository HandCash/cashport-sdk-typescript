# Cashport SDK - Typescript
A Typescript SDK to integrate CashPort in your apps. https://cashport.io

# Installing
Include the dependency in your project:
```javascript
npm install cashport-sdk --save
```

# Getting Started
This section contains all the steps required to integrate *Cashport* in your app.

## 1. Get the API Credentials.

Go to [https://cashport.io/developers](https://cashport.io/developers.html) and apply for the *API Credentials*. 

In the meanwhile you can use this `API_ID` to start developing.

> Remember this are just temporal credentials.

## 2. Create an Authorization Request

First of all, you have to include an html element where Cashport will build the custom components:

```html
<div id="cashport-container"></div>
```

Some basic imports and initializations: 

```typescript
import {
    AuthorizationRequest,
    Cashport,
    GrantedAuthorization,
    PaymentRequestFactory,
    PersonalInfoPermission,
    SignTransactionRequestBuilder
} from 'cashport-sdk';

const appId = 'your-app-id';
let cashport: Cashport = new Cashport();
```

Then you can enable the Cashport login:

```typescript
let cashport = new Cashport();
let permissions = [PersonalInfoPermission.HANDLE, PersonalInfoPermission.FIRST_NAME, PersonalInfoPermission.LAST_NAME, PersonalInfoPermission.EMAIL];
let authRequest = new AuthorizationRequest(permissions, appId);
cashport.loadAuthorizationRequest('cashport-container', authRequest, {
    onDeny: () => {
        // Authorization not granted :(
    },
    onSuccess: (authorization) => {
        let authToken = authorization.authToken;
        let expirationTimestamp = authorization.expirationTimestamp;
        let channelId = authorization.channelId;
        let spendLimitInSatoshis = authorization.spendLimitInSatoshis;
        
        let personalInfo = authorization.personalInfo;
        let handle = personalInfo.handle;
        let firstName = personalInfo.firstName;
        let lastName = personalInfo.lastName;
        let email = personalInfo.email;
    }
});
```

Now the login button it's ready. So when the user clicks the button, the process can be perform in two different ways:
1. If the user **has HandCash installed** in the same device, the app will be launched with the *Authorization Request*.
2. If the device **does not have HandCash installed**, will display a QR code to be scanned by HandCash.

In any case, you will get the *Granted Authorization* in the callback.


## 3. Create a Sign Transaction Request
Once the authorization is granted you have all what you need to perform automatic payment requests, in addition to the personal information.

Let's see how to tip to a $handle.

This is the code you need to create a *Sign Transaction Request* and handle the response. 

```typescript
function sendPayToHandlePaymentRequest(handle: string): void {
    let request = SignTransactionRequestBuilder.useApiId(appId)
        .withCredentials(grantedAuthorization.personalInfo.handle, grantedAuthorization.authToken, grantedAuthorization.channelId)
        .addPayment(PaymentRequestFactory.create().getPayToHandle(handle, 2500))
        .build();
    cashport.sendSignTransactionRequest(request, {
        onStart: () => {
            // Sending request...
        },
        onEnd: () => {
            // The request is done.
        },
        onSuccess: (requestId, transactionId) => {
            // Well done!
        },
        onAuthorizedFundsLimitReached: (requestId) => {
            // Authorized funds limit reached";
        },
        onDeviceNotAvailable: () => {
            // Device not available. The user should check his device connection.
        },
        onInsufficientWalletFunds: (requestId) => {
            // Insufficient funds.
        },
        onTokenExpired: (requestId) => {
            // Token expired. Time to login again.
        },
        onNotAuthorized: (requestId) => {
            // Not authorized, what are you doing?
        },
        onInternalWalletError: (requestId) => {
            // Internal wallet error :(
        },
        onBadRequest: (message: string, errorCode: number) => {
            // Bad request. WTF are your doing!?
        },
        onAPICallError: (message: string) => {
            // API Call error. We did something wrong :$
        }
    });
}
```
